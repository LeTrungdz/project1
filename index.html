			<h1>Adventure</h1> <br>
			Not everybody needs a brutal leg workout, though. If backcountry geysers and solitude are more your jam than heart-raising peaks, hike to Shoshone Geyser or Lone Star Geyser. For a long but minimally challenging hike, take the Lamar River Valley trail near Soda Butte for a chance to spot bison herds, elk, and grizzlies. Uncle Tom’s Trail lets you scale the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone from the brink of Lower Falls to the base via steep, latticed stairs—not exactly terrain for those with acrophobia.

Another restriction on rental 4x4's is that thay can't be taken off the paved road. It is more important that a visitor ask of his selected rental firm what restrictions and limits they impose.  To save some money, it is wise to rent a 4x4 only for the day or days you will actualy need it rather than for a  a longer period.  Also, on many islands gas stations are few and far between. Keep your tank full. In addition, on many islands all the police cars are un-marked private cars that  can sport a blue light when needed.</h4>

There is plenty to do in Paris to satisfy travelers of all tastes. History lovers will marvel at the richness of a city that has seen two major revolutions and was home to many of the most powerful monarchies of Europe. Art lovers could spend a lifetime browsing the galleries of the world famous Louvre museum, the Musee d’Orsay or countless other smaller art museums the city has to offer</h4>
